This project is for running the EMC gateway code on a Darwin Tech dongle 
for development prior to the availability for real hardware.

NB: the Dongle is based on a EFR32BG13P632F512GM32 but real hardware is
based on the EFR32BG21A020F768IM32.

Code in this directory is specific to the EFR32BG13P632F512GM32 all of the
portable code is in ../EMC_gateway_app and ../EMC_gateway_mesh.
